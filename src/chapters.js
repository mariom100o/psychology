      "A young, hard-working woman in New Orleans, Louisiana, Tiana works two jobs in order to achieve her dream of becoming an entrepreneur, opening her own restaurant. Despite this dream, she had recently been diagnosed with schizophrenia, prescribed antipsychotic medication in order to control the symptoms of her disease, keeping her competent enough to function and continue to be a productive member of society. Charlotte, Tiana’s best friend and the daughter of one of the richest and most influential men in New Orleans, informs Tiana of a prince’s arrival in New Orleans and her plan to marry him, and to assist her in convincing him to marry her by making beignets for a large Mardi Gras event at her estate. What Tiana isn’t aware of is that Charlotte is suffering from body dysmorphic disorder, going to extreme lengths to maintain her image in order to convince a prince to marry her. Charlotte also notably suffers from bulimia nervosa, gobbling on Tiana’s beignets and preventing digestion to counteract the guilt of her overeating, with Tiana unknowingly enabling her.",
